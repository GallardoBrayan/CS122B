LIKE predicate report



When searching for which to include in our movie list we surrounded every field in our query’s where clause with the percent sign (‘%’). This will lead to queries that look like this 

SELECT DISTINCT movies.id,title,year,director,banner_url,trailer 
FROM stars 
INNER JOIN stars_in_movies ON stars.id = stars_in_movies.star_id 
INNER JOIN movies ON movies.id = stars_in_movies.movies_id 
INNER JOIN genres_in_movies ON genres_in_movies.movies_id = movies.id                       
WHERE title LIKE %term% AND year LIKE %9% ORDER BY title ASC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0

This query will return all movies in our database that have a “term” anywhere in the title and the digit 9 anywhere in the year. We follow this Pattern for other search fields as well. For searching via title we drop the first % forcing our queries to start with the letter rather then just containing it.
