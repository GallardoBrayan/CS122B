All source has been compiled using Eclipse and is ready for deployment. However, if it needs to be recompiled, It could also be compiled using the following commands :

cd fabflix
javac ./WEB-INF/source/fabflix/*.java -d WEB-INF\classes -cp ".;WEB-INF/lib/*;WEB-INF/classes/*;D:\Program Files (x86)\tomcat\lib\*" -target 1.7 -source 1.7

jar -cvf ../fabflix.war *

This will compile the classes then create a war for deployment. Please replace "D:\Program Files (x86)\tomcat" with the directory of a local tomcat installation. To deploy this, either place this file into the  var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ folder or use the manager webapp.  If ran a linux machine replace the “;” with “:”

To run the Python Script type the following into the command prompt (python 3.5):

Python ScripttoParseLogs.py mylog.log mylogServer1.log mylogServer2.log
